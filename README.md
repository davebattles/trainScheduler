# Train Schedule Tracker
---
Train Schedule Application that incorporates `Firebase` to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with `Moment.js`. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

The repo is mainly an excercise to create familiarity with `Firebase`.

  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
